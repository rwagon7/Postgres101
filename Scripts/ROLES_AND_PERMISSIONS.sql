-- Important Conisderations It is important to note that to remove a superuser role, one needs to be a superuser.
-- To remove non-superuser roles, you will need the privilege to create a role using the CREATE ROLE statement.

-- If we accidentally try to remove a role that has been referenced in any database,
-- PostgreSQL raises an error. In this case, one has to take two steps:

-- step1
-- to swap owner ship -- drop owned by --drop the unwanted role
REASSIGN OWNED BY api TO dba; DROP OWNED BY api; DROP ROLE abi;

-- step2

-- GRANT STATEMENT
--the GRANT statement is a powerful tool used to assign privileges to a role, allowing it to alter database objects like tables, views, functions, and more.
-- GRANT privilege_list | ALL ON  table_name TO  role_name;
-- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE

-- creating test data
-- CREATE ROLE anshul LOGIN PASSWORD 'geeks12345';
-- creating players table name
-- select * from players;

GRANT [ALL | SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | INSERT] ON [TABLE_NAME] FROM [ROLES];z  
REVOKE [ALL | SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | INSERT] ON [TABLE_NAME] FROM [ROLES];

-- revoking assigned roles in hierarchy
-- useful testcases 
-- CREATE ROLE abhishek LOGIN PASSWORD 'geeks12345';

REVOKE [ALL | SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | INSERT] ON [TABLE_NAME] FROM [ROLES];
